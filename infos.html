            <h2>Age Range</h2>
            <p><b>15 and Above</b>- Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in our country. Some people can barely function in the morning without first drinking a cup of coffee. Customers ranging 15 years old and above will be our target customers. We consider that age because we thought that they can afford to buy and also they are already drinking coffee. These are the years where they become more responsible about the beneficial effects of coffee in their lives especially in their health. These ages also prefer to sit and relax while taking a sip of coffee while reading, studying or having a meeting. Teenagers, adults and seniors cannot ignore the aroma of coffee especially in times of cold seasons. Aside from being energized by drinking a cup of coffee it can also help them boost their cognitive ability towards the day.
